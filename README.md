# MySafeIp

MySafeIp is a web app acting as a trusted IP source for firewalls.
It allows registered people declare their IP manually or automatically on the app and to be allowed by their firewalls on the fly.
Users can:
- Declare one or more IP;
- Declare a link accessible to everyone: MySafeIP acts like a url redirector and registers client IP on the fly;
- Create an auth token for mysafeip-client;

MySafeIP can be easily installed with docker: https://github.com/yvguim/mysafeip-compose
MySafeIp-client can be configured easily too: https://github.com/yvguim/mysafeip-client
